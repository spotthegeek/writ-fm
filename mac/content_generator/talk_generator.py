WRIT-FM Talk Segment Generator

Generates long-form talk show content for the talk-first radio format.
Uses Claude CLI for scripts and Kokoro TTS for rendering.

Segment types:
  Long-form (primary content, 1500-3000 words):
    deep_dive       - Extended single-topic exploration
    news_analysis   - Current events through late-night lens (uses RSS headlines)
    interview       - Simulated interview with historical/fictional figure
    panel           - Two hosts discuss topic from different angles
    story           - Narrative storytelling, true stories from music/culture
    listener_mailbag - Invented listener letters + responses
    music_essay     - Extended essay on artist/album/genre

  Short-form (transitions):
    station_id      - 15-30 word station identification
    show_intro      - 80-150 word show opening
    show_outro      - 60-120 word show closing

Usage:
    uv run python talk_generator.py                                # Current show
    uv run python talk_generator.py --show midnight_signal --count 5
    uv run python talk_generator.py --type deep_dive --topic "why vinyl matters"
    uv run python talk_generator.py --all --count 3                # 3 per show
